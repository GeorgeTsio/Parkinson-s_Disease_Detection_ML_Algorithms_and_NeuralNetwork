# Parkinson's_Disease_Detection_Using_ML_Algorithms

This is an attempt to detect Parkinson's disease using some Machine Learning algorithms based on patient's voice. Firstly, I did some descriptive statistics in order to have a better view of the data. After that, I preprocess the data and I apply some machine learning algorithms such as : Logestic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, K Neighbors and XGBoost. Finally, I compare all these algorithms according to some metrics.
